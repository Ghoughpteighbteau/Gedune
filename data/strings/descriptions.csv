gedune_dahaki,SHIP,"An destroyer, with a devastating weapons load-out. Equipped with a short range phase teleporter. Most effective when used in groups.

The Dahaki is one of the very few ships that remain in service since the collapse of the Gedune Empire, and the materials required to build one of these fearsome ships disappeared along with the Gedune home world. When one of these ships are destroyed in combat, it is common procedure to recover as much of the vessel as possible, and given time rebuild the Dahaki from the parts of other fallen Gedune ships.

To most Gedune, the Dahaki is a symbol of the power they once commanded.",,,

gedune_kyirus,SHIP,"A highly advanced scout, capable of blistering speeds but has surprisingly little firepower. The Kyirus is one of the older designs that the Gedune can still manufacture, and as with all old Gedune tech, it would be unwise to underestimate it. Most of the Kyirus is actually engine, or more precisely a nuclear Burndrive. The Kyirus is highly automated, and practically flies itself - or at it would if it didn't need a crew to pilot it.

Almost every weapon on the Kyirus is integrated, meaning that the class is very inflexible. even so, it is one of the best scout ships you could hope to get your hands on.

This ship was originally designed to clean out scrap from a planets orbit. The Kyirus is able to fly though dense debris fields at high velocity thanks to the dual magnetic shunters mounted on the front of the vessel.

A little known fact is that all Gedune ships are Nuclear, a fact that is apparent in ships like the Tenzen, Dahaki and the kyirus. almost every system onboard these ships are powered directly by their nuclear cores, even their weapons.",,,

gedune_mozok,SHIP,"this ship will get your cargo home safe. It's got enough weaponry to put a lasher to shame, and is capable of immense bursts of speed.

The Mozok class ship is a multi purpose hauler, capable of transporting a surprising amount of fuel or cargo depending on which type of container it tows.

This one has no attachment, making it more suited to a support role.",,,

gedune_mozok_t,SHIP,"this ship will get your cargo home safe. It's got enough weaponry to put a lasher to shame, and is capable of immense bursts of speed.

The Mozok class ship is a multi purpose hauler, capable of transporting a surprising amount of fuel or cargo depending on which type of container it tows.

This one has a fuel tank attached.",,,

,,,,,
gedune_nanda,SHIP,"this frigate packs a serious punch, although all those weapons leave no room for a shield generator, and its armour is surprisingly thin. the Nanda is most suited to medium range combat.

When the Gedune still had access to the materials necessary to build their mighty ships, the Nanda was considerably more dangerous, with far better armour, weapons and a shield.

Like the Dahaki, only a few of the original Nandas remain, but those that still have their shields and armour are a threat that starfarers can't afford to ignore.",,,
gedune_tenzen,SHIP,"this ship was deigned with one thing in mind: the pursuit and capture of ships, with weapons that will make short work of anything less than a cruiser and the speed necessary the catch them.

The Tenzen does not cope very well when out numbered, because of the huge flux requirements of its weapons, and yet it exceeds in guerrilla warfare thanks to its ability to activate a nuclear burn in its engines.

In the hands of a skilled captain the Tenzen is a force to be reckoned with.",,,
,,,,,
gedune_flarepd,WEAPON,"An interdictor flare system. These flares try to collide with inbound targets, forcing detonation, and bypassing armour common to heavy ordinance.

The flares are crudely constructed vessels with a basic guidance packages capable of holding active plasma shunted from a ships power core. Once a flare is activated the vessel releases stored plasma, propelling the flare towards incoming targets. 

These flares do not give off an effective decoy to missile guidance systems, and so, rely entirely on a physical collision with the target. Ironically these flares are themselves vulnerable to interference from enemy point defense.

The guidance system is capable of working with onboard ECCM to enhance flare tracking.",Point Defense,,
gedune_repeater,WEAPON,"Affectionally known as the "spam cannon", this gun can sure as hell kick out a beating, although accuracy declines sharply with prolonged use.",,,
gedune_kitsune,SHIP,"A surprisingly high ordinance missile frigate. A relatively new design, the Kitsune can be often be assembled from the dead hulks of destroyers. If given the opportunity, these ships can unleash a terrifying amount of missile powered fury.",,,
gedune_chua,SHIP,"A new design that utilises high intensity energy beam weapons. Gedune Pilots don't like these fighters, because they often become their coffins.",,,
gedune_duri,SHIP,"Using FlarePD systems, A Duri wing can unleash a swarm of flares that may, or may not actually hit something.",,,
gedune_plasma,WEAPON,"Each energy burst contains a mix for charged particles and unstable elements created by nuclear fission. Contact initiates an explosion that can strip away the armour of most ships.

Frigate captains are advised to use extreme caution if faced with such a weapon.",,,
gedune_edart,WEAPON,"Using physics that only the Gedune understand, four energy based projectiles are launched and home in on their target. An effective support weapon.

Each projectile is guided by a virtual line created in subspace. Each line has a unique signature matched with that of the projectile it was created to guide, this signature acts like a quantum "glue" forcing the projectile to follow it.",,,
gedune_kdart,WEAPON,"A very efficient kinetic weapon. Energy based projectiles are launched and propelled by two armlike magnetic field generators at high velocity.",,,
gedune_disruptor,WEAPON,"A very simple weapon that emits a steady stream of ionised particles.",,,
gedune_bakoros,SHIP,"Designed by the Gedune to dismantle scrapped ships, the Bakoros class drone carrier is entirely self sufficient.",,,
gedune_phase_repeater,WEAPON,"Almost identical to the standard repeater, the phase repeater makes use of a phase coil to energise each shot.",,,
gedune_scythe,WEAPON,"A modified reaper launcher, each Scythe torpedo comes with a guidance system at the cost of a lower yield.",,,
gedune_maelstrom,WEAPON,"A serious torpedo launcher. The perfect weapon for the lazy bomber",,,
gedune_reithe,WEAPON,"A very strange weapon, originally designed to tear wreckage to pieces, it does just as well against operational ships.",,,
gedune_byakuri,SHIP,"A very new design, the Byakuri is a very compact and effective carrier with quite a sting to its name.",,,
